# Reservio - Project
The project was done as part of the Mobile Applications course for the Military University of Technology

# Description
Reservio is a mobile application that allows reservations to be made at restaurants near the user after specifying the range in which the 
application is to look for those restaurants. Restaurants are retrieved from the API, and reservations are saved in the database. 
After selecting a restaurant, the user sets the date and time he wants to book a table for. Additionally, he selects 
the table number and how many people the table will be reserved for. After booking, the user can view his/her reservations which are sorted from the earliest to the latest ones. 
In addition, after clicking on such a reservation, he can edit or delete it. The entire application was written in Java in Android Studio.
